      <h2>Hi, I'm Michael!</h2>
      <h3>
        I'm in my fourth year in HCDE at the University of Washington.<br>
        I was born and raised in the Bay Area before coming to Seattle for<br>
        college. In my free time I love hiking around Washington, trying<br>
        new food spots, working out, or playing some video games. Last<br>
        summer my roommates and I rescued our best friend Walden, whoâ€™s<br>
        shown in the picture above. After graduation, I want to go into<br>
        UX Design and possibly work for a startup!<br><br>
