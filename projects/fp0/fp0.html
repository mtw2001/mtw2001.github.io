        <h2>FP0: Final Project Proposal</h2>
       
        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>
            For my final project, I will be creating a web application that plays the music video,<br>
            from YouTube, for the song that the user is currently listening to on Spotify.<br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Envisioned Interface</h3>

        <p>
            <img src="sketches.jpg" alt="Envisioned Interfaces" width="750" height="auto"><br><br>
        </p>
    
        <h3>Versions</h3>

        <p>
            The first version of my project will include the basic functionality of displaying<br>
            the music video for the song that is being played. This version will include Firebase<br>
            login authentication, and a way to link the account to the user's Spotify account.<br>
            This will be fully functional, but will lack stylistic elements or options that<br>
            will be added in the final version.<br><br>

            The final version of the project will build on the previous, but implement more features.<br>
            This includes CSS styling, logo, a menu bar, and an options popup that provides a couple<br>
            of simple options for the Firebase/Google account.<br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Development Process</h3>
        
        <p>
            1. Revisit previous version of this idea from HCDE 310. This was created in Python over a year<br>
            ago, so I do not exactly remember how the interactions with Spotify and YouTube APIs took place.<br><br>

            2. Convert old .py file into Javascript. This will not take too long, I anticipate<br><br>

            3. Fix current issue with YouTube API quota limit. This may require more backend work on getting<br>
            a developer API account from Google.<br><br>

            4. Reformat previous HTML documents to better suit current knowledge of HTML.<br><br>

            COMPLETED VERSION 1<br><br>

            5. Begin adding CSS styling. Fonts, artistic elements, name of the application, logo, etc.<br><br>

            6. Add options page with account information and a logout button.<br><br>

            7. Add options for dark mode, auto-fullscreen, auto-mute.<br><br>

            COMPLETED VERSION 2<br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Unknowns</h3>

        <p>
            I am fairly unfamiliar with API syntax for Javascript, so I will need to relearn how my old<br>
            project works and figure out if/how to create this in Javascript. Also, I am not sure<br>
            what I want the web application to look like stylistically, so I will need to spend time<br>
            designing the site so that it looks polished. Additionally, I am unfamiliar with Firebase<br>
            and how to implement it. This will likely take some time to figure out.<br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Stretch Goals</h3>

        <p>
            1. Increase accuracy when seeking in a song on Spotify. Previously, this worked, but could<br>
            be off by a second or two do to run-time of the script.<br><br>

            2. Reverse controls? Show the user previously watched music videos, which they can select<br>
            and then the song starts playing on Spotify too?<br><br>
