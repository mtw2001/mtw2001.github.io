        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>
            For this mini-project, I created a simple version of the classic snake game using p5 and p5play<br>
            libraries. This was implemented through Javascript and HTML coding. Below, I will go into detail<br>
            on how I created this game. <br><br>

            <b>Step 1:</b><br>
            I began this project by looking at different versions of snake games online. I decided to begin<br>
            developing my game by creating the classic grid background. I settled on a light and dark blue<br>
            color scheme and wrote p5.js code to create this checkerboard pattern. The grid is 24x24 on a<br>
            canvas size of 480x480.<br>
            <img src ="./grid.PNG" alt = "Grid Image" width="400" height="auto"><br><br>

            <b>Step 2:</b><br>
            Next, I began creating the snake object and experimenting with ways to control it. This required<br>
            me to create a snake class within my javascript, where I would be able to implement many functions<br>
            for use in my game logic. I began by creating a simple square that would move in the last pressed<br>
            arrow key direction. This "snake" moved much too fast for the game, so I had to figure out how<br>
            to change the framerate of the game to make it move slower. Here is a gif of the original<br>
            movement speed.<br>
            <img src ="./progress.gif" alt = "Fast Snake Gif" width="400" height="auto"><br><br>
            
            <b>Step 3:</b><br>
            Once I figured out the framerate issues, it was time to begin adding logic and more features<br>
            to the game. The first addition was a "food" item that would spawn on a random square of the grid<br>
            This was pretty easy to implement using the random function to select a square on the grid.<br>
            What was more difficult, was detecting when the snake ran into the food and moving the food<br>
            to a new random square. This was implemented through my checkFoodCollision function.<br><br>

            <b>Step 4:</b><br>
            Step four was quite difficult. It was increasing the length of the snake for each food eaten<br>
            and getting the lengthened snake to follow the path of the head around the grid. This feature<br>
            was addressed mainly through turning the snake into a vector of multiple squares, so I could<br>
            increase or decrease the size by adding or removing elements from the vector. The logic involved<br>
            in getting the snake's body to follow its head was pretty confusing, and I looked at the code<br>
            for many different online snake games to figure this out. This was all implemented through<br>
            the various functions of my snake class, such as grow(), draw(), update(), and the constructor<br><br>


            <b>Step 5:</b><br>
            Step five was creating the end conditions for my game. I wanted the game to end if the snake ran<br>
            into the walls of the canvas, or into its body. This was actually pretty simple to implement, and<br>
            occurs in the checkCollision function of the snake class. This function detects both wall and body<br>
            collisions and returns the value of true, which triggers the gameOver function. I then created the<br>
            "Game Over" screen, which is entirely red and says game over. I then implemented a button that would<br>
            refresh the page and allow the user to play again. This was tricky and actually required the<br>
            implementation of an HTML button instead of a p5 element.<br><br>

            <b>Step 6:</b><br>
            The final step of creating my game was to add some necessary game features, such as a score counter<br>
            and some fun sounds. I added a score counter to the bottom right of the screen, which would be<br>
            initialized to zero every time the site was reloaded and increase by one for each piece of food<br>
            eaten. This would also display on the game over screen so users can see their score. I then added<br>
            a fun noise for whenever the snake eats a piece of food and a game over sound when the game ends.<br>
            Finally, I decided to make the game more difficult as the score increases by ramping up the frame<br>
            rate correlating to the players score. This will make the snake move faster and require faster<br>
            reaction speed to achieve higher scores.<br><br>

            <b>Step 7:</b><br>
            Now, it was time to publish my website using the developer toolchain walkthrough. This actually proved<br>
            to be pretty confusing and took me longer than I anticipated. After following the tutorial from class<br>
            and rereading all of the class Discord discussions, I was able to get my game to show up at my intended<br>
            URL on my GitHub pages site. However, there was one large issue that took me a while to figure out.<br>
            When I hosted my site locally, everything worked perfectly, but when I hosted in on GitHub pages,<br>
            the game would break and freeze whenever the snake ran into a piece of food. This turned out to be<br>
            an issue with playing audio on a website. After solving this issue, my game was finally working and<br>
            finished!<br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Issue Deep Dive</h3>

        <p>
            The largest issue I ran into was with p5 sound and my game breaking when I played it on GitHub pages.<br>
            The issue here was that websites aren't allowed to play sound until the user interacts with the website.<br>
            This is a feature that is in place to prevent websites from immediately bombarding the user with videos<br>
            or audio that they do not want to hear. This issue stumped me for a while, but I figured out through<br>
            online forums after a while that I needed to load my sounds through a preload() function at the beginning<br>
            of my javascript file. This took a couple tries to implement correctly, but eventually resolved my issue<br><br>

            Another large issue that I encountered was getting the snake body to follow the head as it moved around<br>
            the page. Once again, the internet assisted me and led me in the right direction. To accomplish what I<br>
            wanted, I had to restructure the way that my snake object was formed into a vector of different pieces.<br>
            This meant that I had to rewrite most of my code to interact with the snake as a vector variable.<br>
            I had to create many different functions to allow the snake to move properly, such as draw(), update(),<br>
            and grow(), each contributing a small part to the overall function of my snake. I really thought that<br>
            a game as simple as snake would be very simple to make, but there were many hiccups that gave me trouble<br>
            throughout the process of creating this game.<br><br>
        </p>


        <h3>Ideas for the Future</h3>
        
        <p>
            Improving this game, in my opinion, would entirely revolve around visuals. The game is a 24x24 grid<br>
            of squares, which is not super visually appealing. I would love to improve it by making the snake<br>
            look like an actual snake and make the food pictures of fruit such as apples and oranges. My ideal<br>
            game would look similar to the Google Snake game that comes up when you search Snake on Google.<br><br>
            <img src ="./Capture.PNG" alt = "Google Snake Game" width="400" height="auto"><br><br>
            This version of the game is very visually appealing and has effects for when the snake eats fruit<br>
            or runs into the wall. I'm not sure how difficult it would be to add features like this, but<br>
            I think it would do a lot to improve the user experience of the game.
