        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>
            This assignment was an introduction to the p5.js Javascript library, which has many features <br>
            for creating art. The project consists of six sketches of varying complexity. Below is a <br>
            description of each of the six sketches. <br><br>

            <a href = "./s1/index.html"><b>Sketch 1:</b></a><br>
            Sketch 1 is a static image. My sketch creates a target shape with three red rings generated<br>
            center of the page. It uses a for loop to generate multiple circle, alternating between red<br>
            and white, starting at the biggest circle in order to create the target effect.<br><br>

            <a href = "./s2/index.html"><b>Sketch 2:</b></a><br>
            Sketch 2 had to generate a piece of static artwork using randomness. I chose to have my sketch<br>
            generate 100 circles, with random sizes, located randomly on the canvas, with random colors.<br>
            Every time the page is refreshed, the circles will be regenerated into a new random pattern.<br><br> 
            
            <a href = "./s3/index.html"><b>Sketch 3:</b></a><br>
            Sketch 3 had to create an infinite loop that will change over time continuously. I chose to <br>
            build upon my second sketch and infinitely generate circles of random size and color around <br>
            the page and create other smaller circles inside of each circle. <br><br> 

            <a href = "./s4/index.html"><b>Sketch 4:</b></a><br>
            Sketch 4 had to respond to human input. I created a simple drawing panel that places small <br>
            circles whenever the mouse is being clicked. The user can click and drag to draw lines and <br>
            the color of the line will fluctuate through the rainbow of RGB colors.<br><br>

            <a href = "./s5/index.html"><b>Sketch 5:</b></a><br>
            Sketch 5 had to output audio to the browser. To accomplish this, I created a canvas where<br>
            the user drags a circle around the page. Horizontal position on the page affects the frequency<br>
            of the tone played, and vertical position affects the amplitude of the tone. The tone will be<br>
            played whenever the mouse is being clicked. Also, the color of the circle will change with<br>
            horizontal and vertical position.<br><br>

            <a href = "./s6/index.html"><b>Sketch 6:</b></a><br>
            Sketch 6 had to combine audio output and user input. I created a canvas with 9 different<br>
            colored circles on the center of the window. Each circle has a different color and produces<br>
            a different tone. Clicking a circle will play its assigned tone for a brief moment and changed<br>
            the background of the canvas to the color of the clicked circle. This sketch was the most time<br>
            consuming out of the 6. Below is a progress picture of this sketch in its early stages.<br><br>

        <h3>Issues</h3>

        <p>
            1. My first issue arose when I created sketch 4. I struggled to find a way to get the line<br>
            color to cycle through the rainbow. To accomplish this I had to reference an only RGB color<br>
            picker and analyze how the RGB code changed as the rainbow is cycled through. I then replicated<br>
            this in my code inside of an array for the current color and had the value change by 1 every time<br>
            a circle was drawn, eventually cycling back to the original color of red (255, 0, 0).<br><br>

            2. My second large obstacle occured when creating sketch 6. I wanted to have 9<br>
            clickable buttons on the screen, but I was unable to find a way to tell which button was<br>
            being clicked. After searching the web for a bit, I decided that a good course of action<br>
            would be to make each circle an object of class "button". I was then able to make a function<br>
            for what happens when each circle was clicked on by referencing the variables required by the<br>
            constructor function.<br><br>

            3. The third and final obstacle of this mini-project occured during the write-up process.<br>
            I struggled for a while to create a grid layout for my gallery and on how to link to each<br>
            sketch in a separate window that fits to the width and height of the window. This required<br>
            a lot of Googling and reading about CSS Grids. For resizing the canvas appropriately, I had<br>
            to go back through each of my sketches and change variables so that the sketch would properly<br>
            resize to the window's width and height. I also had to add a function that would resize the<br>
            canvas if the page size is altered while viewing a sketch.<br><br>
        </p>


        <h3>Ideas for the Future</h3>
        
        <p>
            1. I would love to explore the p5.sound library further and perhaps recreate popular songs<br>
            in a sketch. This was an idea that I had when creating my sound sketches, but I was a bit<br>
            confused on the science behind frequencies, so I chose to keep it simple.<br>
            2. I would like to create a full drawing panel with different tools. Sketch 3 was a basic<br>
            drawing panel, but I would love to expand on this for a future project.
