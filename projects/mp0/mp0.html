        <h2>MP0: Portfolio Page</h2>
       
        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>
            Creating this website was the first mini-project for the course. This website was created <br>
            using HTML and CSS, with plans to implement Javascript in the future. <br><br>

            <b>Step 1:</b><br>
            The site began with a very bare-bones HTML site provided by the instructor. From this,<br>
            I began by changing the font to "Poppins", which is one of my personal favorites and<br>
            is a font that I use on my own design portfolio.<br><br>

            <b>Step 2:</b><br>
            Next, I created the navigation bar at the top of the page using some CSS transitions.<br>
            For this, I made each menu item grey, with a hover color of black. When within a certain<br>
            page, the navigation bar will continue to show that menu item in black. Clicking on my<br>
            name will return the user to the main page of the site.<br><br>
            <img src="progress.jpg" alt="Progress Photo" width="750" height="auto"><br><br>

            <b>Step 3:</b><br>
            After this, I spent a significant amount of time organizing my site's various folders to<br>
            be formatted correctly. I had to resolve the issue of the navigation bar breaking when<br>
            being copied over to a new HTML page within my site due to directory issues. This<br>
            required the use of ".." multiple times to refer to different files and pages. Once I<br>
            squared this issue away, I began adding content to each of my pages, which was rather<br>
            straight forward with just some simple HTML.
        </p>

        <h3>Issues</h3>

        <p>
            1. The first issue that I encountered was pushing my site to Github and having it<br>
            appear live at the domain. This was largely due to some user error in how I set up<br>
            my Github assets and was quickly resolved.<br><br>

            2. My second issue arose when creating the navigation bar at the top. Certain pages<br>
            weren't linking to each other. This was because of directory issues in my HTML code<br>
            that were created when I copied the navigation bar code to each different page. This<br>
            was solved through some research into directories using ".." to refer to the parent<br>
            directory of a folder.
        </p>
    
        <h3>CSS Transition</h3>

        <p>
            The CSS transition that I chose to implement for my site is changing the color of<br>
            the navigation bar text when a user hovers over each. I chose this feature<br>
            because it easily conveys to the user that the menu items are clickable and it<br>
            will provide an indication of which subpage the user is viewing. This was <br>
            implemented by creating a navigation bar item in my CSS style document that has <br>
            a different color for default and hover states.<br><br>
            <img src="transition.gif" alt="Progress Photo" width="750" height="auto"><br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Ideas for the Future</h3>
        
        <p>
            1. Add light/dark mode to the site through Javascript<br>
            2. Explore more styling with CSS and Javascript<br>
            4. Potentially expand this framework to fully code my own portfolio and move<br>
            away from using Wix for my portfolio.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
